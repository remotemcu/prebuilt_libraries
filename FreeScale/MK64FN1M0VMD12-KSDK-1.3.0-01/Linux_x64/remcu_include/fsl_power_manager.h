 * Defines power mode. Used in the power mode configuration structure
 * (power_manager_user_config_t). From ARM core perspective, power modes

 * (all stop modes).
 * List of power modes supported by a specific chip along with requirements for entering
 * and exiting of these modes can be found in the chip documentation.

 * by POWER_SYS_GetLastModeConfig(), which returns reference to the structure of current mode.
 * List of power mode configuration structure members depends on power options available
 * for specific chip. Complete list contains:
 *  mode - Kinetis power mode. List of available modes is chip-specific. See power_manager_modes_t
 *   list of modes. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  sleepOnExitOption - Controls whether the sleep-on-exit option value is used (when set to true)
 *   or ignored (when set to false). See sleepOnExitValue. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  sleepOnExitValue - When set to true, ARM core returns to sleep (Kinetis wait modes) or deep sleep
 *   state (Kinetis stop modes) after interrupt service finishes. When set to false, core stays
 *   woken-up. This item is common for all Kinetis chips.
 *  lowPowerWakeUpOnInterruptOption - Controls whether the wake-up-on-interrupt option value is used
 *   (when set to true) or ignored (when set to false). See lowPowerWakeUpOnInterruptValue. This
 *   item is chip-specific.
 *  lowPowerWakeUpOnInterruptValue - When set to true, system exits to Run mode when any interrupt occurs while in
 *   Very low power run, Very low power wait or Very low power stop mode. This item is chip-specific.

 *   (when set to true) or ignored (when set to false). See powerOnResetDetectionValue. This item is
 *   chip-specific.
 *  powerOnResetDetectionValue - When set to true, power on reset detection circuit is enabled in

 *
 * This function switches to one of the defined power modes. Requested mode number is passed
 * as an input parameter. This function notifies all registered callback functions before
 * the mode change (using  kPowerManagerCallbackBefore set as callback type parameter),
 * sets specific power options defined in the power mode configuration and enters the specified
 * mode. In case of run modes (for example, Run, Very low power run, or High speed run), this function
 * also invokes all registered callbacks after the mode change (using kPowerManagerCallbackAfter).
 * In case of sleep or deep sleep modes, if the requested mode is not exited through
 * a reset, these notifications are sent after the core wakes up.
 * Callbacks are invoked in the following order: All registered callbacks are notified
 * ordered by index in the callbacks array (see callbacksPtr parameter of POWER_SYS_Init()).
 * The same order is used for before and after switch notifications.
 * The notifications before the power mode switch can be used to obtain confirmation about
 * the change from registered callbacks. If any registered callback denies the power
 * mode change, further execution of this function depends on mode change policy: the mode
 * change is either forced (kPowerManagerPolicyForcible) or exited (kPowerManagerPolicyAgreement).
 * When mode change is forced, the result of the before switch notifications are ignored. If
 * agreement is required, if any callback returns an error code then further notifications
 * before switch notifications are cancelled and all already notified callbacks are re-invoked
 * with kPowerManagerCallbackAfter set as callback type parameter. The index of the callback
 * which returned error code during pre-switch notifications is stored (any error codes during
 * callbacks re-invocation are ignored) and POWER_SYS_GetErrorCallback() can be used to get it.
 * Regardless of the policies, if any callback returned an error code, an error code denoting in which phase
 * the error occurred is returned when POWER_SYS_SetMode() exits.
 * It is possible to enter any mode supported by the processor. Refer to the chip reference manual
 * for list of available power modes. If it is necessary to switch into intermediate power mode prior to
 * entering requested mode (for example, when switching from Run into Very low power wait through Very low
