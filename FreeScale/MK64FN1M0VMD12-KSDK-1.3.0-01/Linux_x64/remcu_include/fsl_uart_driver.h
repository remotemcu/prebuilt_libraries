 * Some devices count the UART instances with LPUART(e.g., KL27) or UART0(e.g.,
 * KL25) together. However, they are  different IPs with separate drivers:
 * LPSCI for UART0, LPUART for LPUART. In such cases, this UART driver 
 * only works with specific UART instances.
 *
 * For example, in KL27, there is LPUART0, LPUART1 and UART2. For LPUART0 and
 * LPUART1,  use the LPUART driver. For UART2, use this driver and
 * pass in 2 as the instance number. 0 and 1 are not valid.
